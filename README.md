Next Best Thing

A landing page for a book entitled "The Next Best Thing" which was written to help entrepreneurs discover the means to creating the next, BIG, thing.

What I learned from this project:
-How to create a web page using Bootstrap 4
-How to use custom CSS to make a Bootstrap website appear less like a standard bootstrap website
