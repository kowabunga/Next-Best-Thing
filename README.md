#Next Best Thing

A landing page for a book entitled "The Next Best Thing" which was written to help entrepreneurs discover the means to creating the next, BIG, thing.

What I learned from this project:

-How to create a web page using Bootstrap 4

-How to use custom CSS to modify pre-existing Bootstrap CSS styles

-CSS Variables
